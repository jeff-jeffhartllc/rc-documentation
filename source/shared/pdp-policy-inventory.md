## Purpose

This document records **live Personalized Data Permission (PDP) row policies** captured from regiscorp.domo.com on 2026-07-13 (Admin session). It supplements **PDP overview and testing** with exact policy names, groups, filter columns, and dataset IDs.

For **how PDP ties together** — Domo groups, the **Ownership** custom attribute, and dynamic row filters — see the architecture section in [PDP overview and testing](./pdp-overview-and-testing.md#pdp-architecture-groups-custom-attributes-and-row-policies).

## How to open PDP in Domo

| Step | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Data** → search for the dataset (e.g. **Daily Sales Master 2**) |
| 2 | Open the dataset → select the **PDP** tab |
| 3 | Confirm **Row Policies** sub-tab; toggle **Enable PDP - Row Filtering** should be **ON** |

## Daily Sales Master 2 (primary franchisee dataset)

This is the dataset referenced by app filter labels ("Source: Daily Sales Master 2") and the main PDP scope for REGIS FRANCHISEE APP.

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Domo dataset name** | Daily Sales Master 2 |
| **Dataset ID** | `8d851507-f995-4918-abc8-90032b2eff65` |
| **Type** | DataFlow output |
| **Owner** | _TBD — data owner_ |
| **Scale** | 204 columns · 1,513,506 rows (as of 2026-07-13) |
| **PDP status** | **Enabled** — Row Filtering ON |
| **PDP URL** | https://regiscorp.domo.com/datasources/8d851507-f995-4918-abc8-90032b2eff65/details/rls |

### Row policies

| Policy name | Type | Data access / filter | Groups & people | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **All Rows** | Open (all data) | All Data | All Admins and DataSet Owners; **AllDataAccess** (49 people) | For users that can access all salons without restriction |
| **Franchisee** | User (filtered) | `FranchiseeNumber` **EQUALS** `Ownership` (dynamic) | **RestrictedDataAccess** (15 people) | Restricted users based on Ownership / franchisee association |

### Franchisee policy detail

The **Franchisee** policy uses **Dynamic PDP**:

| Filter component | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Column | `FranchiseeNumber` |
| Operator | EQUALS |
| Value type | **DYNAMIC** |
| Dynamic attribute | **Ownership** |

Domo resolves each user's **Ownership** attribute at login and filters rows where `FranchiseeNumber` matches that value. Franchisee users in **RestrictedDataAccess** therefore see only salons tied to their ownership / franchisee entity.

### Domo groups referenced (Daily Sales Master 2)

| Group name | Group ID | Approx. members | Role in PDP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AllDataAccess** | `2014419418` | 49 | Full row access via **All Rows** policy (**dynamic group membership**) |
| **RestrictedDataAccess** | `950576281` | 15 | Franchisee-scoped access via **Franchisee** policy (**dynamic group membership**) |

Use dedicated franchisee test accounts in dataset sharing / group membership for PDP validation.

## domo_regis.MonthlyMetrics (scorecard upstream input)

Warehouse-fed monthly metrics dataset used as an input to **Store Scorecard by Brand ETL**. PDP on this dataset uses the **same franchisee pattern** as Daily Sales Master 2.

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Domo dataset name** | domo_regis.MonthlyMetrics |
| **Dataset ID** | `f303a86a-67b5-49fa-8874-195eab30506c` |
| **Owner** | _TBD — data owner_ |
| **Scale** | 117 columns · 47,479 rows |
| **Tags** | PROD, PDP |
| **PDP status** | **Enabled** — Row Filtering ON |
| **PDP URL** | https://regiscorp.domo.com/datasources/f303a86a-67b5-49fa-8874-195eab30506c/details/rls |

![domo_regis.MonthlyMetrics PDP row policies](../../assets/monthly-metrics-pdp-policies.png)

### Row policies (domo_regis.MonthlyMetrics)

| Policy name | Type | Data access / filter | Groups & people | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **All Rows** | Open (all data) | All Data | All Admins and DataSet Owners; **AllDataAccess** (49 people) | For users that can access all salons without restriction |
| **Franchisee** | User (filtered) | `FranchiseeNumber` **EQUALS** `Ownership` (dynamic) | **RestrictedDataAccess** (15 people) | Restricted users based on Ownership / franchisee association |

Scorecard app pages consume **Store Scorecard Data_Brand Peers** (ETL output), not this dataset directly — but franchisee PDP on scorecard pages depends on aligned policies across the scorecard lineage (MonthlyMetrics → ETL → Store Scorecard Data_Brand Peers).

## domo_regis.FactDailySales (warehouse sales fact)

Upstream warehouse fact table feeding **Daily Sales ETL 2**. PDP uses the same franchisee pattern as Daily Sales Master 2.

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Domo dataset name** | domo_regis.FactDailySales |
| **Dataset ID** | `5bdaf9aa-0950-432e-a9ce-eaa7cffb2796` |
| **Owner** | Keela Davis |
| **Scale** | 145 columns · 1,513,506 rows |
| **Tags** | PROD, PDP |
| **PDP status** | **Enabled** — Row Filtering ON |
| **PDP URL** | https://regiscorp.domo.com/datasources/5bdaf9aa-0950-432e-a9ce-eaa7cffb2796/details/rls |

| **Franchisee** | User (filtered) | `FranchiseeNumber` **EQUALS** `Ownership` (dynamic) | **RestrictedDataAccess** (15 people) | Restricted users based on Ownership / franchisee association |

This is the root sales fact in the Daily Sales lineage. If franchisee users can query this dataset directly (outside app cards), the same **Franchisee** policy applies.

## Store Scorecard Data_Brand Peers (scorecard ETL output)

Scorecard dataset output from **Store Scorecard by Brand ETL**. Powers **Store Performance Report Card** and **Store Performance Scorecard** in both apps (there is no separate “Store Scorecard Data” dataset).

## Datasets without PDP

| Dataset | Domo / logical name | PDP | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Salon dimension | **DimSalon** / **domo_regis.MonthlySalonCounts** | **No** | ETL input only; franchisee scoping on downstream datasets |

## Dataset-level capture complete

All PDP-enabled datasets used by REGIS APP and REGIS FRANCHISEE APP have been documented. Policies follow the standard **All Rows** + **Franchisee** pattern.

## API reference (for automation)

Internal Domo API used by the PDP UI (session cookie auth):

```
GET /api/query/v1/data-control/{dataset-id}/filter-groups?options=load_associations,include_open_policy,load_filters,sort&paginate=true&limit=50&offset=0
```

Returns policy names, group IDs, and filter parameters. Standard sharing permissions (not PDP) are at:

```
GET /api/data/v3/datasources/{dataset-id}/permissions
```

## Change management

When adding a franchisee user:

1. Set the user's **Ownership** attribute to the correct franchisee identifier (must match `FranchiseeNumber` values in Daily Sales Master 2).
2. Confirm **RestrictedDataAccess** dynamic group rules include the user (and they are not in **AllDataAccess**).
3. Test in REGIS FRANCHISEE APP per **PDP overview and testing**.

When a salon changes franchisee ownership:

1. Update upstream salon master / DimSalon.
2. Re-run **Daily Sales ETL 2**.
3. Confirm `FranchiseeNumber` values in Daily Sales Master 2 reflect the change.
4. Re-test affected franchisee users.
